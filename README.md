# iiPythonx/website

This is my personal repo for [my website](https://iipython.dev).  
It's completely static, and can be served with any modern web server (I personally use nginx).  

If you do host it yourself, make sure you deny access to .git/ or other sensitive locations.

It used to be based on a Python backend, but I've moved to 100% static sites now.
