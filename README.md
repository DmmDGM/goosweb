# iiPythonx/website

This is my personal repo for [my website](https://iipython.dev).  
It's completely static, and can be served with any modern web server (I personally use nginx).  

If you do host it yourself, make sure you deny access to .git/ or other sensitive locations.

This is a [Nova](https://github.com/iiPythonx/Nova) project, so building it is as simple as running `nova build`.  
It used to be based on a Python backend, but I've moved to static sites nowadays.
