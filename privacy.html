            <h3 id = "preface">Preface</h3>
            <p>Hai! I&#39;m iiPython and am <strong>not</strong> a lawyer, so take everything listed here with a grain of salt. The following document describes all the data I collect to keep my services running.</p>
            <h3 id = "what-s-collected">What&#39;s collected</h3>
            <p>Manual data collection:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    ROBLOX Gamepass Information (inventory.pixellicio.us)
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stored in RAM to speed up subsequent requests</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    URL Destination (old.iipython.dev)
                    <ul>
                        <li>Required for the URL shortener to function</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Image dimensions, color type, and metadata (images.iipython.dev)
                    <ul>
                        <li>Image info is stored in RAM to assist with caching</li>
                        <li>No data about images is written to disk</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Automatic collection (all sites):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Page visited
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gives me basic analytics about where requests are going</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>IP address</li>
                <li>
                    Estimated city, state, and country
                    <ul>
                        <li>Used to block and report IPs that are attempting to harm my services</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id = "where-it-s-stored">Where it&#39;s stored</h3>
            <p>All analytical data is stored on a 100% locally owned server, under my own roof. No third party has access to this data, as I don&#39;t share or sell any visitor information.</p>
            <p>Additionally, access logs (which contain most of the recorded data) are encrypted and purged once a month.</p>
            <p>There is <strong>one</strong> exception to these rules however:
            If there is a lot of malicious traffic coming from an IP, I will file an abuse report with whoever administered the IP. Nothing else is shared besides the ip address though.</p>
            <h3 id = "pesky-government">Pesky Government</h3>
            <p>If for some reason the FBI/NSA/Police (or any other US agency) wants access to my service data, they will be immediately declined unless they have a search warrant (since then I can&#39;t do anything :c).</p>
            <p>However, even if they seize my drives, all user data is encrypted.</p>
            <h3 id = "ccpa---gdpr">CCPA & GDPR</h3>
            <p>My services are exempt from CCPA and GDPR data protection laws.<br>However, you can still email me to have your IP address purged from my logs (even if you don't live in a protected area).</p>
            <h3 id = "cloudflare">Cloudflare</h3>
            <p>It&#39;s worth noting that I use cloudflare for DNS and DDoS protection. Therefore, the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/">Cloudflare Privacy Policy</a> also applies.</p>
            <h3 id = "questions-">Questions?</h3>
